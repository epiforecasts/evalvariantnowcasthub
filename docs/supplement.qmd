# Additional models not evaluated in this work

The following models began submissions following the initial assessment period (October 9th, 2024 to June 4th, 2025).

| Model name | Description | Citation | Data Sources | Locations | Output Type | Ensemble? |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| `open_hier_mlr` | A Bayesian hierarchical multinomial logistic regression (MLR) model for nowcasting COVID variants using variant counts based on GISAID sequences. Regression coefficients are modeled hierarchically across locations. | Abousamra E, Figgins M, Bedford T (2024) Fitness models provide accurate short-term forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 variant frequency. PLOS Computational Biology 20(9): e1012443. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012443 | GISAID | All | Point and probabilistic | No |
| `gisaid_hier_mlr` | A Bayesian hierarchical multinomial logistic regression (MLR) model for nowcasting COVID variants using variant counts based on INSDC sequences. Regression coefficients are modeled hierarchically across locations. | Abousamra E, Figgins M, Bedford T (2024) Fitness models provide accurate short-term forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 variant frequency. PLOS Computational Biology 20(9): e1012443. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012443 | INSDC | All | Point and probabilistic | No |
| `ensemble` | An ensemble of the hub forecasts, created by taking an equally weighted sample of all forecasts that submit samples for a given week, using the function linear_pool from the hubEnsembles package. | https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubEnsembles/tree/main | Other model submission files | All | Point and probabilistic | No |
| `PyHMLR` | A Bayesian hierarchical multinomial logistic regression model with Dirichlet-Multinomial observation process. The model uses hierarchical hyperpriors to enable partial pooling across locations and clades. Location-specific concentration parameters allow the model to adaptively learn appropriate uncertainty levels for each location. Linear trends are modeled in logit space with standardized time variables. | https://github.com/trobacker/pymc_modeling | COVID Variant Nowcast Hub S3 target data | All | Point and probabilistic | No |

## Additional results

![Fig. S10 Comparison of the observed clade proportions by sequence collection week across nowcast dates (columns) in the NCBI GenBank data used by the Hub (top row) and the California specific data source for sequencing called terra (bottom row). Colors indicate clade, dashed line indicates the nowcast date. In most weeks, the California specifc dataset terra has observed clade proportions for a more recent week than the NCBI GenBank dataset for California.](../output/figs/supp/CA_source_seq_props.png)

![Fig. S11 Ratio of the number of sequences available in the NCBI GenBank dataset for Californi compared to the California-specific dataset across collection dates for a subset of nowcast dates (colums). Patterns indicate that even further back in time, the GenBank dataset at most makes up between 50% and 90% of the California specific data volume, with a particular drop off closer to the nowcast date.](../output/figs/supp/CA_source_seq_level_comparison.png)
