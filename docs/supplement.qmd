# Additional models not evaluated in this work

The following models began submissions following the initial assessment period (October 9th, 2024 to June 4th, 2025).

| Model name | Description | Citation | Data Sources | Locations | Output Type | Ensemble? |
|----|----|----|----|----|----|----|
| `open_hier_mlr` | A Bayesian hierarchical multinomial logistic regression (MLR) model for nowcasting COVID variants using variant counts based on GISAID sequences. Regression coefficients are modeled hierarchically across locations. | Abousamra E, Figgins M, Bedford T (2024) Fitness models provide accurate short-term forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 variant frequency. PLOS Computational Biology 20(9): e1012443. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012443 | International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaboration (INSDC) | All | Point and probabilistic | No |
| `gisaid_hier_mlr` | A Bayesian hierarchical multinomial logistic regression (MLR) model for nowcasting COVID variants using variant counts based on INSDC sequences. Regression coefficients are modeled hierarchically across locations. | Abousamra E, Figgins M, Bedford T (2024) Fitness models provide accurate short-term forecasts of SARS-CoV-2 variant frequency. PLOS Computational Biology 20(9): e1012443. https://doi.org/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1012443 | Global Initiative on Sharing All Influenza (GISAID) | All | Point and probabilistic | No |
| `ensemble` | An ensemble of the hub forecasts, created by taking an equally weighted sample of all forecasts that submit samples for a given week, using the function linear_pool from the hubEnsembles package. | https://github.com/hubverse-org/hubEnsembles/tree/main | Other model submission files | All | Point and probabilistic | No |
| `PyHMLR` | A Bayesian hierarchical multinomial logistic regression model with Dirichlet-Multinomial observation process. The model uses hierarchical hyperpriors to enable partial pooling across locations and clades. Location-specific concentration parameters allow the model to adaptively learn appropriate uncertainty levels for each location. Linear trends are modeled in logit space with standardized time variables. | https://github.com/trobacker/pymc_modeling | COVID Variant Nowcast Hub S3 target data | All | Point and probabilistic | No |

## Data landscape

![Fig. S1 Distribution of sequence counts compared to population size in the United States. A. Total number of sequences collected and submitted by the final evaluation date for each state during the period from September 2024 to June 2025. Color indicates whether the location's sequences are among the top 90th percentile of all sequences submitted nationally B. Population size for each jurisdiction, ordered by total number of sequences submitted. Color indicates whether the population size is among the top 90th percentile of the total population.](../output/figs/data_figs/supp/bar_chart_all_seq_counts_final.png)

## Submission metadata

![Fig. S7 Model submission coverage by location and nowcast date for each participating model. Tiles colored by model-specific colors indicate dates and locations where the model submitted a forecast. Gray tiles indicate missing submissions.](../output/figs/metadata/supp/submission_heatmaps_by_model.png)

![Fig. S8 Summary of model submission coverage across all models. Color indicates the number of models that submitted forecasts for each location and nowcast date combination, ranging from 0 (no models) to 6 (all models).](../output/figs/metadata/supp/submission_heatmaps_summary.png)

![Fig. S9 Evaluation sequence counts by location and nowcast date. Color indicates the total number of sequences available in the evaluation data (log scale) for each location and nowcast date combination. Gray tiles indicate nowcast date-location pairs with no sequences across all horizons.](../output/figs/metadata/supp/eval_sequence_counts_heatmap.png)

![Fig. S10 Analysis of historical lags from collection to submission. Each line represents a week of data and the y-axis is the ratio of how much data we have at the given data lag compared to 19 weeks after that week , treating 19 weeks as the maximum delay (and thus data at 19 weeks has a ratio of 1). The dashed blue line represents when we perform evaluations (a 90 day, or 14 week, lag)](../output/figs/supp/data_lags_by_week.jpeg)

![Fig. S11 Proportion of evaluated days that contained no partial observations as of the nowcast date by nowcast horizon, summarised across all locations and nowcast dates. Days which had partial observations as of the nowcast date are excluded from the main text evaluation analyses, consistent with our stated evaluation plan and in order to prevent incentivising modelers from predicting the already observed clade frequency.](../output/figs/supp/prop_no_partial_obs_overall.png)

![Fig. S12 Proportion of evaluated days that contain partial observations as of the nowcast date by nowcast horizon for each location across all nowcast dates. Days which had partial observations as of the nowcast date are excluded from the main text evaluation analyses.](../output/figs/supp/prop_no_partial_obs_loc.png)

![Fig. S13 Average of relative scaled skill scores on the Brier score in the US excluding California. In this figure, we compute the relative scaled skill for each horizon, location, and nowcast date and then average across the relative scaled skill scores, which has the effect of weighting each horizon, location, and nowcast date equally rather than weighting by the number of observed sequences](../output/figs/supp/avg_rel_skill_brier.png)

![Fig. S14 Average of relative scaled skill scores on the energy score in the US excluding California. In this figure, we compute the relative scaled skill for each horizon, location, and nowcast date and then average across the relative scaled skill scores, which has the effect of weighting each horizon, location, and nowcast date equally rather than weighting by the number of observed sequences](../output/figs/supp/avg_rel_skill_energy.png)

Colors indicate clade, dashed line indicates the nowcast date. In most weeks, the California COVIDNet data has observed clade proportions for a more recent week than the NCBI GenBank dataset does for California.](../output/figs/supp/CA_source_seq_props.png)

![Fig. S18 Ratio of the number of sequences available in the NCBI GenBank dataset for California compared to California COVIDNet across collection dates for a subset of nowcast dates (columns).
