| Hub-baseline | A Bayesian multinomial logistic regression model that makes predictions at the national level. This model uses a linear in logit space model for the growth of the variants and makes the same predictions for each state. | [citation] | NextStrain | All | Point and probabilistic | No |
| UMass-HMLR | A Bayesian hierarchical multinomial logistic regression (HMLR) model for nowcasting COVID variants. Regression coefficients are modeled hierarchically across variants and locations. | [citation] | NextStrain | All | Point and probabilistic | No |
| UGA-multicast | A multinomial logistic regression model with no fancy features for nowcasting COVID-19 variants. | Feng, Y., Goldberg, E. E., Kupperman, M., Zhang, X., Lin, Y., and Ke, R. (2024). CovTransformer: A transformer model for SARS-CoV-2 lineage frequency forecasting. Virus Evolution, to appear. | NextStrain | All | Probabilistic | No |
| LANL-CovTransformer | CovTransformer is a streamlined single-layer transformer architecture augmented with linear input and output layers, using embedding dimensions of 8 and dual attention heads. CovTransformer is an integrated ensemble of models, which first makes a 14 day prediction using 5 models (Stage 1 models). | Feng, Y., Goldberg, E. E., Kupperman, M., Zhang, X., Lin, Y., and Ke, R. (2024). CovTransformer: A transformer model for SARS-CoV-2 lineage frequency forecasting. Virus Evolution, to appear. | NextStrain for inference, GISAID for training | All | Point | No |
| CADPH-CATaMaran | We use similar parameters as our PANGO lineage Multinomial Logistic Regression on CalCAT, except that at any time 31 days of data are obscured prior to the fitting period to exclude noisy data being backfilled. This model can accommodate resampling eventually. | Wadford et al. Implementation of California COVIDNet - a multi-sector collaboration for statewide SARS-CoV-2 genomic surveillance.

| CADPH-CATaLog | Fits a logistic growth function to data. Based on Althaus, Christian L., et al.
