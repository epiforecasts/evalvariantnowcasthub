Decisions to be made:
- [ ] Including ensemble in scoring? Not currently in scores in PR branch
- [ ] Date range to evaluate: October 2024 - June 2025? If we extend, we include `blab-gisaid-hier-mlr` which started submitting in July 2025.
- [ ] Include/exclude partially observed location-days? I think we should score all days even if partially observed at time of nowcast, and only focus on this in results.
