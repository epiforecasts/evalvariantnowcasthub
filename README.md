# Evaluation of nowcasts submitted to the U.S. SARS-CoV-2 Variant Nowcast Hub

This codebase characterises the SARS-CoV-2 variant data and evaluates and analyses the performance of nowcasts submitted to the [U.S. SARS-CoV-2 Variant Nowcast Hub](https://github.com/reichlab/variant-nowcast-hub) during its first season (October 2024 - May 2025).

For more details on the data stored on the Hub and the outputs solicited from teams for submission to the Hub, please see the Hub guidelines above.
